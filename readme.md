# Geospatial Dashboard: Memo App

This project showcases the development of an interactive geospatial dashboard. Within this application, users have the ability to generate, modify, and remove memos directly on the map interface. The creation of this code was significantly aided by the use of GitHub Copilot, providing an advanced collaborative coding experience.
